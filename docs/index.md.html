**Scientific cluster**

Introduction
============

`Scientific cluster` provides a virtual simulation on a cluster based on
[LUSTRE](http://lustre.org) (a open-source parallel file system used in HPC) and [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com) (a open-source fault-tolerant cluster
management system). This is arguably the most common architecture used in
scientific computer clusters.

The virtual simulation runs on top of [QEMU](http://www.qemu.org).

The main purpose of this package is to allow administrators of scientific
clusters to test different configurations before deployment.

In the near future we will also support [Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov/index.html) (A user managed container system allowing the deployment of
complex workloads on a cluster).

There might be other components included (for example, OpenLDAP and NFS).

Requirements
============

- An OS that can run QEMU. This was tested on Linux as a host
  environment.  We suspect that it will almost "out of the box" on a
  Mac and it will need some work on Windows
- 12 GB of memory
- ~30 GB of free disk space
- root access


Example configuration
=====================


(add bioconda also)
